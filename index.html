		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<img class="photo" src="assets/images/IMG_9683.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Image holder">
		<p>I started out my career in music and came to the United States in 1999 under a scholarship.  A Bachelor's and a Master's degree later, I decided to take on the business world and gain a little more financial stability in my life.  I was very fortunate to enter the world of international development, where I was exposed to democracy work that was being conducted in countries where the democratic process was either very new or non-existent.</p>
		<p>During my time working in the development sector, I was able to hone my project management skills, increase my knowledge on industries like clean energy, and better my technical knowledge on regulatory and compliance matters when it comes to implementing US Government contracts.</p>
		<p>Throughout my studies and professional experiences, I have always been a technophile but did not have a chance to develop these skills. Since my recent move to the Bay Area, though, I have had the opportunity to get my feet wet in the tech industry. My ultimate goal is to be able to meld  my previous experiences in music and international development with the programming skills that I am acquiring now.</p>
